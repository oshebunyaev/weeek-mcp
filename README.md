An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [Weeek](https://weeek.net): manage **tasks** through the public REST API and browse the **knowledge base** through Weeek's internal API, exposed as MCP **Resources** so you can search and select KB documents as content (not links) from your MCP client.

## Features

### Tasks and boards

Public REST API — projects, boards, board columns, and the full task lifecycle: create, update, complete, move between columns, assign and unassign members.

### Knowledge base

Full CRUD. Weeek has no public KB API, so the server calls Weeek's **internal JSON API** (`api.weeek.net/ws/{id}/kb/...`) using cookies from a saved browser login. Documents are rendered to Markdown and published as MCP **Resources** (`weeek-kb://<id>`). Read/list/search/create/rename/delete go over the JSON API; **in-place body editing** speaks Weeek's collaborative protocol directly (Hocuspocus/Yjs), because bodies live in a shared document the REST API only serves a snapshot of. Content is converted between Markdown and Weeek's ProseMirror format automatically.

### Capability-aware

Task tools appear when an API token is set; KB tools and resources appear when login credentials or a cached session are present.

## Production remote MCP

The server supports the original stdio transport and the MCP SDK's official
Streamable HTTP transport. HTTP exposes exactly `/mcp` and the unauthenticated
`/health` probe. Every `/mcp` request must carry `Authorization: Bearer
<MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>`; secrets never belong in the URL.

### Security model

- `WEEEK_ALLOW_WRITE=false` is the default. In this mode only read tools are advertised.
- HTTP startup fails unless `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` and `WEEEK_ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_ID` are set.
- `WEEEK_READ_PROJECT_IDS` optionally filters task/project reads. Enabling writes requires a non-empty `WEEEK_WRITE_PROJECT_IDS` whitelist.
- Direct write tools are not advertised. Each permitted write is exposed as `propose_weeek_*`; it validates scope, reads the current object, returns a preview and a one-time token, and performs no mutation.
- `confirm_write` accepts only that token. The original payload is loaded from SQLite, scope is checked again, and the token is atomically consumed before execution. Default TTL is 10 minutes.
- `weeek_delete_task`, `weeek_delete_task_comment`, and `weeek_kb_delete` are never exported.
- Read tools and proposal tools carry `readOnlyHint=true`; `confirm_write` is annotated as modifying.

The public task API token is created inside one WEEEK workspace and WEEEK scopes
its requests to that workspace. `WEEEK_ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_ID` is the operator's
explicit binding for that token. The KB client additionally compares the live
browser-session workspace id with the configured id on every entry path.

### Local stdio

Read-only is the default even locally:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[kb]'
playwright install chromium       # omit when KB is not needed
export WEEEK_API_TOKEN='...'
export MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio
weeek-mcp
```

To test writes locally, also set `WEEEK_ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_ID`,
`WEEEK_ALLOW_WRITE=true`, and `WEEEK_WRITE_PROJECT_IDS`.

### WEEEK API token and workspace id

In WEEEK open the target workspace, then **Settings → API**, create a token, and
store it only as `WEEEK_API_TOKEN` on the host. Requests act as the user who
created the token. Copy the workspace id from the workspace URL/application
state and set it as `WEEEK_ALLOWED_WORKSPACE_ID`. Never bake `.env` into an image.

### Seed the KB browser session

The production path uses a pre-created Playwright `storage_state` file. On a
trusted computer with a browser:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
WEEEK_STORAGE_STATE="$PWD/secrets/storage_state.json" \
uv run --extra kb playwright install chromium

MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
WEEEK_STORAGE_STATE="$PWD/secrets/storage_state.json" \
uv run --extra kb weeek-mcp-login

chmod 600 secrets/storage_state.json
```

Copy it to the VPS over an encrypted channel, then seed the persistent volume:

```bash
docker compose run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/secrets/storage_state.json:/seed/storage_state.json:ro" \
  weeek-mcp sh -c 'cp /seed/storage_state.json /data/session/storage_state.json && chmod 600 /data/session/storage_state.json'
```

`WEEEK_EMAIL`/`WEEEK_PASSWORD` are optional bootstrap credentials only.
Production defaults to `WEEEK_KB_AUTO_LOGIN=false`; an expired session returns a
clear error and must be reseeded instead of repeatedly logging in.

### Docker + Caddy deployment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
# Edit .env, point MCP_DOMAIN DNS at the VPS, then:
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
curl -fsS "https://${MCP_DOMAIN}/health"
curl -i "https://${MCP_DOMAIN}/mcp"       # expected: 401
```

The MCP container has no published port. Caddy is the only Internet-facing
service and terminates TLS for `https://weeek-mcp.example.com/mcp` and
`/health`; every other path returns 404. `runtime` omits Playwright/Chromium;
set `WEEEK_DOCKER_TARGET=runtime-kb` only when KB support is required. Browser
state and pending proposals live in separate persistent volumes.

### MCP Inspector and remote clients

Start MCP Inspector and enter `https://weeek-mcp.example.com/mcp` as a
Streamable HTTP server, adding the header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

A generic remote-MCP client configuration is:

```json
{
  "url": "https://weeek-mcp.example.com/mcp",
  "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}"}
}
```

The [OpenAI Responses API remote MCP tool](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/tools-connectors-mcp)
accepts the same bearer value in its `authorization` field. ChatGPT's
interactive plugin/connector flow currently expects [OAuth 2.1](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/auth)
rather than a user-supplied static API key; for that UI, put an established
OAuth-capable MCP gateway/identity provider in front of this server and have it
forward the fixed upstream bearer credential. Do not make `/mcp` anonymous as
a workaround.

### Secret rotation

1. Set `WEEEK_ALLOW_WRITE=false` and redeploy.
2. Create a new WEEEK API token, replace `WEEEK_API_TOKEN`, redeploy, verify reads, then revoke the old token.
3. Generate and deploy a new `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`; update every client, then remove the old value from secret storage.
4. Reseed `storage_state.json`, verify KB reads, then invalidate the old WEEEK browser sessions.
5. Rotate `WEEEK_EMAIL`/`WEEEK_PASSWORD` if they were ever configured, then remove them and keep `WEEEK_KB_AUTO_LOGIN=false`.
6. Re-enable writes only after verifying workspace/project whitelists. Existing proposal tokens expire quickly; delete the proposals volume if immediate invalidation is required.

## Installation

### Claude Desktop

1. Download [`weeek-mcp.mcpb`](https://github.com/adalekin/weeek-mcp/releases/latest/download/weeek-mcp.mcpb) from the latest release.
2. Open it (or drag it onto Settings → Extensions) and enter your Weeek API token: Weeek → Settings → API.

That's all for tasks. Desktop runs the server with its own uv, so you don't need Python.

For the knowledge base, sign in once from a terminal. This step needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uvx --from "weeek-mcp[kb]" playwright install chromium
uvx --from "weeek-mcp[kb]" weeek-mcp-login
```

A browser opens: sign in to Weeek and the session is saved. Then switch the extension off and on in Settings → Extensions.

Email and password in the extension settings are optional. With them the server signs in again by itself when the session expires. Without them, or if you use 2FA or SSO, run `weeek-mcp-login` again.

### Other MCP clients

`weeek-mcp` is a plain stdio server, so it works with any MCP client that launches servers as a local subprocess: Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Continue, Zed, VS Code (Copilot agent mode), Gemini CLI, Goose, LibreChat, and others, plus your own agents built on an MCP SDK. It needs Python 3.10+:

```bash
pip install "weeek-mcp[kb]"        # drop [kb] if you only need tasks
playwright install chromium         # knowledge base only
weeek-mcp-login                     # knowledge base only, one-time sign-in
```

If `weeek-mcp-login` or `weeek-mcp` isn't found, pip put them outside your `PATH`: add the scripts directory from `pip show -f weeek-mcp` to it, or use the absolute path in your client config.

Then register the `weeek-mcp` command with your client. Claude Code (`-s user` makes it available in every project):

```bash
claude mcp add weeek -s user -e WEEEK_API_TOKEN=... -- weeek-mcp
```

Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`, or `.cursor/mcp.json` in a project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "weeek": {
      "command": "weeek-mcp",
      "env": { "WEEEK_API_TOKEN": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`) uses a `servers` key and an explicit `type`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "weeek": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "weeek-mcp",
      "env": { "WEEEK_API_TOKEN": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

> **On the knowledge base:** task tools and `weeek_kb_*` are ordinary MCP tools and
> work almost everywhere. Pulling documents in through an attachment menu relies on MCP
> **Resources**, which fewer clients surface. Where they aren't supported, read the KB
> with `weeek_kb_read`/`weeek_kb_search` — the content still lands in context. MCP and
> resources support moves fast per client; check the client's docs before relying on it.

#### Configuration

Environment variables (or a `.env` file, see `.env.example`). Only `WEEEK_API_TOKEN` is required, and only for task tools.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `WEEEK_API_TOKEN` | Task API token. Required for task tools. |
| `WEEEK_EMAIL` / `WEEEK_PASSWORD` | First automated KB login. Optional (skip if 2FA/SSO — use `weeek-mcp-login`). |
| `WEEEK_WORKSPACE_ID` | KB workspace id. Optional — auto-detected via `/ws` when unset. |
| `WEEEK_STORAGE_STATE` | Where the browser session is cached (defaults under `~/.local/state`). |
| `WEEEK_HEADLESS` | `false` to watch the browser during login. |
| `WEEEK_KB_CACHE_TTL` | Seconds to cache the KB document list (default `300`). |
| `WEEEK_DEBUG_LOG` | `1`/`true` to write diagnostic timing/step logs to `~/.local/state/weeek-mcp/debug.log` (some MCP hosts discard stderr). Off by default. |

## Tools

### Tasks

| Group | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Reading & navigation | `weeek_whoami`, `weeek_list_members`, `weeek_list_projects`, `weeek_list_boards`, `weeek_list_board_columns`, `weeek_list_tasks`, `weeek_get_task` |
| Task lifecycle | `propose_weeek_create_task`, `propose_weeek_update_task`, `propose_weeek_complete_task`, `propose_weeek_uncomplete_task`, `propose_weeek_move_task` + `confirm_write` |
| Assignees, watchers, hierarchy | proposal forms of set/remove assignees, set/remove watchers, parent and project-location changes + `confirm_write` |
| Time & attachments | `weeek_task_timer`, `weeek_manage_time_entry`, `weeek_upload_attachment`, `weeek_get_attachment` |
| Fields & comments | `weeek_list_custom_fields`, `weeek_list_task_comments`, proposal forms of add/update comment + `confirm_write` |

### Workspace admin

The upstream administrative tools remain in the codebase but are not advertised
by the hardened server because their mixed action schemas include destructive
operations that cannot be safely represented by the initial whitelist policy.

These take an `action` (create/update/delete/…) rather than one tool per operation — the CRUD is regular and the tool list stays readable. Custom fields live per board, per project or workspace-wide, so that tool takes a `scope` (`global`/`project`/`board`) plus `scope_id`.

### Knowledge base

| Group | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Reading | `weeek_kb_search`, `weeek_kb_list`, `weeek_kb_read` |
| Writing | `propose_weeek_kb_create`, `propose_weeek_kb_update`, `propose_weeek_kb_move` + `confirm_write` |
| Formatting | `propose_weeek_kb_table_widths` + `confirm_write`, `weeek_kb_icons` |

> `weeek_kb_update` with new content writes into the document's shared Yjs document over
> Weeek's collaborative websocket, because that — not REST — is where bodies are saved.
> No browser is involved and the document id is preserved.

### Behavior

**Priorities.** Take either Weeek's number or its label:

| Number | Label |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | low (Низкий) |
| `1` | medium (Средний) |
| `2` | high (Высокий) |
| `3` | hold (Замороженный) |

**Custom fields.** Set with `custom_fields`: on an existing task by field name or id (`{"Ссылка на фичу": "https://…"}`, `null` clears a field, a select takes the option name or id), on `weeek_create_task` by id only — `weeek_list_custom_fields` lists them. A field belongs to the projects it was added to, and Weeek stores nothing when you write to one it doesn't cover, so the write is verified and reported.

**Descriptions.** Editable on an existing task: `weeek_update_task` takes `description` as Markdown (empty string clears it). Weeek's REST API only accepts a description on create — `PUT /tm/tasks/{id}` has no such field — because descriptions sync through the same collaborative channel as KB document bodies, so this writes into that channel and needs the knowledge base session. `weeek_create_task` still takes its `description` as HTML, which is what that endpoint stores.

**Comments.** Read with `weeek_list_task_comments`, written with `weeek_add_task_comment` and rewritten in place with `weeek_update_task_comment` (all Markdown) — an edited comment beats posting a correction under the original. `weeek_delete_task_comment` removes one for good; Weeek keeps no trash for comments. Weeek's public API has no comments at all, so these go through its web API on the knowledge base session; no browser is launched, only the saved cookies.

**Tables.** One size to set: the pixel width of each column (minimum 90). New tables are fitted to the document's content column (~676px) instead of Weeek's 180px-per-column default, and existing widths are carried across a `weeek_kb_update` — a table that gains or loses a column is re-fitted. `weeek_kb_table_widths` sets them explicitly: `widths: [300, 200, 176]` for exact sizes, or `fit: true` to spread a table across the content column.

**Icons.** Pass `icon` to `weeek_kb_create`/`weeek_kb_update` as a single emoji (`🚀`) or as one of Weeek's built-in icon names (`weeek_kb_icons` lists them); an empty `icon` removes it. Listings report the icon a document currently has.

## Knowledge base in Claude context

Each KB document is published as an MCP **Resource** (`weeek-kb://<id>`). In Claude
Desktop you add them from the attachment (**+**) menu of the connected server — browse
the list or narrow it with `weeek_kb_search` — and the client pulls in the **document
content**, not a link.

> **Note on Project Context:** Claude Desktop surfaces MCP resources as attachments.
> Whether a selected resource persists inside a Project's *Context* panel (vs. a single
> conversation) depends on your Claude Desktop version. The content-not-a-link behavior
> works regardless.

## Status & limitations

- **Task tools** follow Weeek's published OpenAPI spec.
- **Knowledge base** uses Weeek's **internal, undocumented** API (`/ws/{id}/kb/...`). It is
  not covered by any stability guarantee and may change without notice; if KB calls start
  failing, the endpoints in [`weeek_mcp/kb/client.py`](https://github.com/adalekin/weeek-mcp/blob/main/weeek_mcp/kb/client.py) are the place
  to look. Login automation targets Weeek's two-step web form
  ([`weeek_mcp/kb/session.py`](https://github.com/adalekin/weeek-mcp/blob/main/weeek_mcp/kb/session.py)); accounts with 2FA/captcha/SSO
  should seed the session with `weeek-mcp-login` instead.
- Document content is ProseMirror/TipTap JSON, converted to/from Markdown by
  [`weeek_mcp/kb/prosemirror.py`](https://github.com/adalekin/weeek-mcp/blob/main/weeek_mcp/kb/prosemirror.py). Editing an existing body
  goes through Weeek's collaborative channel (there is no REST content-write):
  [`weeek_mcp/kb/collab.py`](https://github.com/adalekin/weeek-mcp/blob/main/weeek_mcp/kb/collab.py) speaks the Hocuspocus protocol,
  authenticates with a per-socket ticket, and replaces the `prosemirror` fragment of the
  document's Y.Doc. Authoring covers the common Markdown subset (headings, paragraphs, lists,
  bold/inline code, code blocks, quotes, rules); rich cases like nested lists and tables
  are simplified.
- Table column widths live on the `table_body` node, as a JSON string, and are written
  with the body rather than after it ([`weeek_mcp/kb/tables.py`](https://github.com/adalekin/weeek-mcp/blob/main/weeek_mcp/kb/tables.py)). Cell colors and per-column colors
  are stored alongside the widths but are not exposed as tools yet.
